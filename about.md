I define myself as a passionate software guy. From a young age I have always looked forward to new technologies.

I have seen first-hand how the Internet has grown and evolved. From plain hypertext to the internet of services and cloud computing. I grew up along with the Internet, I have been learning Web tech and programming for more than 15 years.

I am self-taught but an enthusiast and big fan of Computer Science, this has led me to learn and challenge myself every day. I understand Software as more than just code, it is creativity and innovation and a great opportunity to share knowledge with other professionals.

After all, the tool does not make the professional. My principle is "enthusiasts do great things". A tool is just a possible expression of some valid solution to get things done right!

What am I looking for? I am committed to grow, share, build, create and innovate. At the end of the day, to learn and enjoy.
